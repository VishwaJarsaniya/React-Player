00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.300
This is a national emergency.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Detonator's charged.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
We're in a race against the Nazis,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.650
and I know what it means
if the Nazis have a bomb.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.300
They have a 12 month head start. -18.

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:39.500
How could you possibly know that?

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.300
We've got one hope.

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.200
All America's industrial might

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.000
and scientific innovation connected here,

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.000
a secret laboratory.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.400
Keep everyone there until it's done.

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.900
Let's go recruit some scientists.

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.000
Build a town, build it fast.

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.700
If we don't let scientists bring their families

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:06.400
we'll never get the best.

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.500
Why would we go to the middle of nowhere

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.000
for who knows how long?

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.300
Why? Why?

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.200
How about because this is the most important thing

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.000
to ever happen in the history of the world.

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.400
You're the great improviser but this...

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.100
You can't do in your head.

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.000
Are we saying there's a chance

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.700
that when we push that button,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.000
we destroy the world?

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.000
Chances are near zero.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:39.950
Near zero?

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.000
What do you want from theory alone?

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Zero would be nice.

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.000
This is a matter of life and death.

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.200
I can perform this miracle.

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:57.900
World War II would be over.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Our boys would come home.

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:03.000
It's happening, isn't it?

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.000
The world will remember this day.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.750
Our work here will ensure

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.000
a peace mankind has never seen.

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.500
Until somebody builds a bigger bomb.

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.000
You are the man who gave them the power

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
to destroy themselves,

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.000
and the world is not prepared.

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.000
Eight...

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.600
Seven...

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.800
Six...

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Five...

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.300
Four...

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:55.000
Three...

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.900
Truman needs to know what's next.

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:56.500
Two...

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:57.400
What's next?

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:58.000
One.
